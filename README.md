A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
about requirements:

-user can browse through the comics.

-user can also see the comic details, including its description, by tapp on the comics.

-user can search for comics by the comic number and if there any comics cant be loading or number not belong to any comic, it will show to user, as well as the user enter an unvalid number,(i didn't understand the text section).

-get the eplanation by click on more button, Ù‡ am not completely satisfied about the explanation,even though i could scrap the webpage and get the paragraph but i couldn't get the link that inside the paragragh, i know that by useing the tagname[a] i can get the link,but it seem that i couldn't get it

-the user can favorite the comics, by tapp on heart button, it will save in the favorite screen, and user can delete it from the favorite screen.

-user can share the comics with other(as image not as a link).

-the app wil automatic update when new comic is published, i try to build the notifications but it was little bit tricky.
